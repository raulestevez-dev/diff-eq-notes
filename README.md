# diff-eq-notes
My notes reviewing ODEs and PDEs in the 2023 summer. Probably most things here are inaccurate at best and flat wrong at worst. Take all with a grain of sant, I only do it to held myself accountable :)

# ODE notes
In this notes I followed parts of the book: "A First Course in Differential Equations", Third Edition by J. David Logan. 
The choice of this book is based on the fact that I wanted to use a relatively modern book that was more focused on understanding and interpretation of the models/equations
rather than in pure solution computing. I found this book to be very light to read and with the focus on understanding that I was looking for. I highly recommend it, 
even more to engineers that have a little background in ODEs and want to understand why they are they appear everywhere.
# PDE notes
The PDE notes are WIP. The book I'm following is "Partial Differential Equations for Scientist and Engineers" by Stanley J. Farlow.
