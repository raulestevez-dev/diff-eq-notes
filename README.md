# diff-eq-notes
My notes reviewing ODEs and PDEs in the 2023 summer. Probably most things here are inaccurate at best and flat wrong at worst. Take all with a grain of sant, I only do it to held myself accountable :)

# ODE notes
In this notes I followed parts of the book: "A First Course in Differential Equations", Third Edition by J. David Logan. 
The choice of this book is based on the fact that I wanted to use a relatively modern book that was more focused on understanding and interpretation of the models/equations
rather than in pure solution computing. I found this book to be very light to read and with the focus on understanding that I was looking for. I highly recommend it, 
even more to engineers that have a little background in ODEs and want to understand why they are they appear everywhere.
# PDE notes
The PDE notes are WIP. The book I'm following is "Partial Differential Equations for Scientist and Engineers" by Stanley J. Farlow. 
# Compilation
Im using pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22 (TeX Live 2022/dev/Debian) with  TeX Live as TeX distribution.
If you want to compile you'll need my english preamble (found in my dotfiles repo), and change the path of the preamble in the main .tex
