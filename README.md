# my-notes
Notes on my 2023 summer research. Probably most things here are inaccurate at best and flat wrong at worst. Take all with a grain of sant, I only do it to held myself accountable :)

# Latex
In addition to learning about the things I'm taking notes on, I'm also tangentially learning three other things: LaTeX, English, and touch typing. With these notes, I'm consolidating my knowledge and my setup of note-taking with LaTeX. I'm planning on taking my class notes using LaTeX this year, so it's good training and proof of concept.

I'm sure that there are a lot of typos and poorly constructed sentences in my text. English is not my first language, but with these notes, I've been practicing (almost) daily on how to express things in English. It's even more complicated expressing things I've just learned! So please, give me a break if you don't understand something :).

I've also gained a lot of speed in my keyboard typing. Over the last few months, I've been playing a lot of Monkeytype, and they say that I have an average WPM of 76.24 over 1399 tests that I've completed. However, I felt slower when typing things while I was thinking about them. Since the start of summer, I've felt more swift in that sense.

# ODE notes
In this notes I followed parts of the book: "A First Course in Differential Equations", Third Edition by J. David Logan. 
The choice of this book is based on the fact that I wanted to use a relatively modern book that was more focused on understanding and interpretation of the models/equations
rather than in pure solution computing. I found this book to be very light to read and with the focus on understanding that I was looking for. I highly recommend it, 
even more to engineers that have a little background in ODEs and want to understand why they appear everywhere.
# PDE notes
The PDE notes are WIP. The book I'm following is "Partial Differential Equations for Scientist and Engineers" by Stanley J. Farlow. 

# Compilation
Im using pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22 (TeX Live 2022/dev/Debian) with  TeX Live as TeX distribution.
If you want to compile you'll need my english preamble (found in my dotfiles repo), and change the path of the preamble in the main .tex
